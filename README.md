# Word Clock Plugin

Tell the time in words the way a QLOCKTWO does — in German, English, Spanish or French, sized to the board it renders on.

**→ [Setup Guide](./docs/SETUP.md)**

## Overview

A physical word clock lights letters inside a fixed matrix. A split-flap has no dim state, so this plugin renders only the words that would be lit — which is what the matrix visually reduces to anyway — and lays them out for the board it is rendering on.

The phrase moves in five-minute steps (`IT IS QUARTER PAST TEN`, `ES IST VIERTEL NACH ZEHN`, `SON LAS ONCE MENOS CUARTO`, `IL EST ONZE HEURES MOINS LE QUART`). Every phrase in all four languages fits a Note (15×3) as well as a Flagship (22×6); the plugin reads `self.board` at render time and re-wraps accordingly, so one page works on both.

## Template Variables

### Phrase

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `{{word_clock.phrase}}` | Full spelled-out time including the prefix | `IT IS QUARTER PAST TEN` |
| `{{word_clock.phrase_short}}` | Same, without the prefix | `QUARTER PAST TEN` |
| `{{word_clock.prefix}}` | The opener, empty when disabled. Spanish agrees it with the hour | `IT IS` |

### Board Lines

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `{{word_clock.block}}` | The whole laid-out board as one value, rows separated by newlines | `IT IS QUARTER PAST TEN ␤ …` |
| `{{word_clock.line1}}` … `{{word_clock.line6}}` | The same rows individually, each padded to the board width. Rows past the board's height are empty. | `IT IS QUARTER PAST TEN` |

### Details

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `{{word_clock.hour_word}}` | The hour the phrase names, spelled out | `TEN` |
| `{{word_clock.time}}` | Exact time behind the phrase | `10:17` |
| `{{word_clock.step}}` | Five-minute step the phrase represents | `15` |
| `{{word_clock.minute_offset}}` | Minutes past that step (0–4) | `2` |
| `{{word_clock.minute_dots}}` | Color tiles for the offset, empty unless minute dots are on | `{69}{69}` |
| `{{word_clock.language}}` | Active language code (`de`, `en`, `es`, `fr`) | `en` |

## Example Templates

The plugin already lays itself out for the board, so the simplest setup is a **single-plugin page** with no template at all — it fills the board directly, centered.

Inside a template page, put `block` on the **first** line and leave the rest empty. FiestaBoard splits a value containing newlines across the board rows, so this reproduces the same centered layout:

```
{{word_clock.block}}
```

The rows come out padded to the full board width, so the page's own alignment setting leaves them untouched — horizontal placement stays with the plugin's **Alignment** option, vertical centering is handled for you.

To place the clock in one specific row instead, use a line variable:

```
{{date_time.date_pretty}}
{{word_clock.line3}}
```

### Sample page: minute dots

A QLOCKTWO carries four corner dots for the minutes the words cannot express. Turn them on in the plugin settings — they are part of the layout, not something you place in the template:

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| `language` | `en` |
| `rounding` | `down` |
| `show_minute_dots` | `true` |
| `dot_color` | `yellow` |

The page itself stays the same one line:

```
{{word_clock.block}}
```

At **10:33** that renders as `IT IS HALF PAST TEN` plus three dots in the bottom right — one per minute past the five-minute step:

![Sample page with minute dots](./docs/board-sample-dots.png)

On a Note the words sit on the middle row and the dots take the bottom-right corner below them:

![Minute dots on a Note](./docs/board-minute-dots.png)

The dots are dropped when the bottom row has no free tiles — the time always outranks them. They only pair sensibly with `down` rounding; with `nearest` the phrase has already absorbed the difference and the offset is always zero.

**One catch:** `line1`…`line6` and `block` already contain the dots. `{{word_clock.minute_dots}}` is for building a layout row by row out of `phrase_short` and friends — combining it with the line variables prints them twice.

### Don't do this

```
{{word_clock.phrase}}
```

`phrase` is a single string. On a plain line the board cuts it off at the edge — `IT IS TWENTY FIVE PAST TWELVE` loses `TWELVE`. If you want the raw phrase anyway, switch the line to **wrap** in the page editor and leave the lines below it empty; it will then flow across them, though the block sits at the top of the board rather than centered.

The same moment in the other three languages:

## Configuration

| Setting | Type | Default | Description |
|---------|------|---------|-------------|
| `enabled` | boolean | `false` | Enable the plugin |
| `language` | `de` \| `en` \| `es` \| `fr` | `en` | Language the time is spelled out in |
| `timezone` | string | *(empty)* | IANA timezone. Empty follows the FiestaBoard-wide timezone |
| `show_prefix` | boolean | `true` | Show `ES IST` / `IT IS` / `SON LAS` / `IL EST`. Dropped automatically if the phrase would not fit |
| `german_style` | `standard` \| `regional` | `standard` | `VIERTEL NACH ZEHN` vs. `VIERTEL ELF`. German only |
| `umlauts` | `expand` \| `strip` | `expand` | `FUENF`/`ZWOELF` vs. `FUNF`/`ZWOLF` — the board has no umlaut tiles. German only |
| `rounding` | `down` \| `nearest` | `down` | `down` matches a physical word clock |
| `alignment` | `center` \| `left` | `center` | Horizontal alignment of each row |
| `show_minute_dots` | boolean | `false` | Corner dots for the minutes the words cannot express |
| `dot_color` | color name | `white` | Tile color used for the minute dots |

No API key, no network access, no environment variables.

## Features

- German, English, Spanish and French, switchable per board
- `ES LA UNA` vs. `SON LAS DOS` — Spanish agrees the copula with the hour the phrase names, not the hour on the clock
- `IL EST MIDI`, `IL EST MINUIT`, `UNE HEURE` vs. `DEUX HEURES` — French never says "douze heures"
- Standard German (`VIERTEL NACH ZEHN`) and the regional East German / Franconian / Saxon counting (`VIERTEL ELF`, `DREIVIERTEL ELF`)
- `EIN UHR` vs. `FUENF NACH EINS` — the German hour keeps its `S` everywhere except before `UHR`
- Board-adaptive layout: every phrase fits a Note (15×3) and a Flagship (22×6), verified by a test that walks all 24 hours × 12 steps × every language and option combination. French is the tight one at 37 characters (`IL EST QUATRE HEURES MOINS VINGT-CINQ`)
- Umlaut handling for a charset that has none
- QLOCKTWO-style minute dots as colored tiles, skipped when the bottom row is full
- `live_data`, so the board never shows a cached time
- No network calls, so nothing to rate-limit and nothing to leak

## Development

The plugin imports `src.plugins.base` from the FiestaBoard core, so tests need the core repo checked out next to this one:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Fiestaboard/FiestaBoard.git ../FiestaBoard

# Import paths matching how FiestaBoard loads the plugin
mkdir -p plugins && touch plugins/__init__.py
ln -sfn .. plugins/word_clock

python -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install pytest pytest-cov
PYTHONPATH=".:../FiestaBoard" .venv/bin/pytest tests/ --cov=. --cov-report=term-missing
```
